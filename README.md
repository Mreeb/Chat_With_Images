```bash
ollama pull llava
```

### 2. **Install Dependencies**

You will need to install the required Python libraries. You can do so by running the following command:

```bash
pip install streamlit ollama
```

### 3. **Run the Streamlit App**

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit app with the following command:

```bash

### Breakdown of the Formatting:
- **Headings**: Used Markdown headers (`#`, `##`) for clarity and structure.
- **Code Blocks**: Used triple backticks (\`\`\`) for code commands to make them distinct.
- **Image**: The screenshot is linked using the appropriate Markdown syntax for displaying images.
- **Clear Instructions**: Each setup step is clearly separated and detailed, making it easy to follow.

This format ensures readability and ease of use for anyone accessing your repository. Let me know if you need further adjustments!
